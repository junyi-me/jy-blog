I have always been thinking about self-hosting, and in late 2024 I finally had the time and energy to set up a k3s cluster at home.

So then I thought, what should I host? I already have a personal website, and that seemed like a good place to start. But I also wanted to start something new, so I came up with the idea of a blog.

This will be the place where I keep my notes and thoughts primarily about coding. I'm sure I will find it helpful in the future, and to those who stumble upon it, I hope you like it too.
